# Wildvision.tv

This repo contains the code for the next version of [Wildvision.tv](https://wildvision.tv). It's written in Scala Play 2.5.2. The design is not finalised yet, and I'm currently building the Backstage portal to allow presenters to manage their portfolios.

There are 2 reasons I'm doing this rewrite:

1. To learn more Scala and the Play framework by rebuilding Wildvision.tv using as least code as possible.
2. To manage persistent data as much as possible within the web app such that I can utilise as much of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) as possible, in order to keep costs low.
