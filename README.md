# Wildvision.tv

This repo contains the code for what was going to be the second version of Wildvision.tv. However its Editor and I decided to shut down the site instead. So enjoy this software as a view of what might have been. It's written in Scala Play 2.5.2. The design was never finalised yet, and I got as far as building the Backstage portal to allow presenters to manage their portfolios.

The  3 reasons I attempted to do this rewrite:

1. To learn more Scala and the Play framework by rebuilding Wildvision.tv using as least code as possible. 
2. So anyone who's interested can see how the site is coded and maybe contribute to improvements. (Please feel free to make a pull request) I was too embarassed to make the old site's PHP code public!
3. To manage persistent data as much as possible within the web app such that I can utilise as much of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) as possible, in order to keep costs low.
